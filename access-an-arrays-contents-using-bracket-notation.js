/*let ourVariable = ourArray[0];
// ourVariable equals "a"
In addition to accessing the value associated with an index, you can also set an index to a value using the same notation:

ourArray[1] = "not b anymore";
// ourArray now equals ["a", "not b anymore", "c"];
Using bracket notation, we have now reset the item at index 1 from "b", to "not b anymore".

In order to complete this challenge, set the 2nd position (index 1) of myArray to anything you want, besides "b".

let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// Only change code below this line
myArray[[1]] = "joana";
// Only change code above this line
console.log(myArray);
